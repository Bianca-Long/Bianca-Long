# 🏎️ Bianca Long: Accelerating Code & Conquering Tracks 🚀

Hey there! I'm **Bianca Long**, a 3rd-year **Bachelor of Computing** student specializing in **Software Engineering** at **Belgium Campus iTversity**.  
By day, I'm a determined developer in training; by night (or weekends), I'm racing down the quarter-mile track — a passion I’ve had since I was nine years old. Motorsport has sharpened my precision, resilience, and ability to perform under pressure — the same qualities I bring to my code.  

I approach every project like I do a race: **fast, focused, and always striving for excellence.** 🏁
